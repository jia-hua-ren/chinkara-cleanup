# chinkara-cleanup

code cleanup of Chinkara game

This is a code cleanup of [Chinkara Goat Paradise](https://github.com/jia-hua-ren/pyweek-35-chinkaraoshiman).

Right now it is a bunch of spaghetti code, especially the way the mobs are constructed. The shadow, goat, and player have a lot of similarity so adding classes will reduce the same codes used.

Other optimizations and cleanups will be applied as fit.
